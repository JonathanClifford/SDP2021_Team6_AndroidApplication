# SDP2021_Team6_AndroidApplication

This is for the use of the Android Application for Team 6's Senior Design Project for Active Windows (Jonathan Clifford, Frank Cremonini, Griffin Manns, & Connor Moore)
( Advisor: Professor Arman Pouraghily)

This application was created for the Active Windows Project organized by the Manhattan2 Initiative. 

This app is for communicating to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Servers using the MQTT protocol and using Amazon Cognito for authentication. Currently, the app allows a user to 
select a window, and send commands to that specific window while also monitoring its status. Commands include opening, cracking, or closing a window while also monitoring 
what the latest status for the window is. This app can run with the built in emulator on Android Studio as well as also working on a Samsung Galaxy S10. 

__________INSTALLATION__________
Step 1: Install Android Studio. 
Step 2: Go to file -> import project, and select these files. 
Step 3: Here, the app should be fully loaded into the Android Studio Enviorenment. Go to the top right and click "Run". Note that it will take a while in order to run as 
Android Studio fully compiles and installs the program every time. Once the app is installed, it will automatically boot up in the emulator, allowing you to run the app.
